# Shopify Projects - Take Home Test

This is a take-home project for a company which aims to simulate the day to day functions of the position there. The following questions are answered:

- Can you work GIT?
- Can you get connected to a Shopify Dev Store?
- Can you figure out the Shopify theme file structure?
- Can you make some basic changes in files to see the results?

## Rules of the Test

1. Create a product in dev store, or seed it with test data. There's a option to seed test products, check out the Shopify CLI for details.
2. Change the colour (something vivid, like red) of the Price on the product detail page - a.k.a. PDP - commit this into the repository.
3. Change the border of a product that shows on listing page, a.k.a. PLP or Collection. - make the change really obvious and commit this into the repo.
4. Create a button on the cart page that makes an AJAX call to clear the cart contents - https://shopify.dev/api/ajax/reference - commit this to the repo when done.
5. STRETCH excercise - add an option into the Product template that offers a rich text input in the Theme Customize as follows:
   name: Product Extra Info
   type: richtext

Render this field onto the product detail page (PDP) after the product description. Render it conditionally to show if 'Product Extra Info' has been entered. Once it's showing on the PDP - commit this to the repo.
Here's your chance to get creative; is there anything else you could do for mobile/desktop modes that would show a super long 'Product Extra Info' in a better way for the screen size?
